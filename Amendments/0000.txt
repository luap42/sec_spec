# Abstract

This amendment to the specification discusses, how future changes should be proposed and formalized;
the suggestion is to collect a list of "amendments" -- such as this one -- containing adopted,
or considered proposals.

# Amendments

The Specification can be altered by so-called amendments, which are text documents published according
to this one -- possibly containing further specification, rescindals and discussions.

All Amendments are enumerated with a four-digits number. The number SHOULD be indicative for the point
in time, at which the amendment is suggested (relative order), but this is not obligatory and exceptions
may be made.

A full list of all amendments can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/luap42/sec_spec.

Keywords, that are not specifically defined in an amendment, SHALL be interpreted according to the original
Specification and the definitions therein.

# Process

An amendment can have any of the following status:

    "informational" if it is non-binding with regards to the specification, mostly containing
        articles of discussion;

    "proposed" if a new feature or any other change to the Specification is proposed for the
        first time;

    "under consideration" if the proposal is under serious consideration and has a reasonable
        chance to advance to the next state pending resolution of possible issues;

    "living standard" if the amendment is considered formal policy, equal to the Specification;

    "deprecated" if the amendment is no longer considered good-practice or has been substituted
        by a more recent amendment or a new version of the specification;

    "unsafe!" if the amendment has been deprecated or rescinded on the basis of adverse security
        flaws or other issues of similar gravity.
